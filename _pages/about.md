## 🔍 About Me

Here is **Peng Lai (赖鹏)**. I’m a second-year **M.Phil. student** in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at **Southern University of Science and Technology**, advised by Prof. [Guanhua Chen](https://ghchen.me/). I previously received my B.Sc. degree from **Sichuan Normal University**.

My current research focuses on **LLM-as-a-judge**, **reward modeling**, and **reinforcement learning**. I aim to enhance model evaluation capabilities, enabling models to understand their own limitations and progressively improve—advancing the paradigm of **self-reflective and continuously improving language models**.

I am currently doing an internship at **Alibaba International**.
